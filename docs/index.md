## [Architectural Decision Records (ADR) Index for Natural Resource Ministries (NRM)](https://bcgov.github.io/nr-arch/)

An architecture decision record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. An architecture decision (AD) is a software design choice that addresses a significant requirement.

The aim of this page is to:

1. Motivate the need for and benefits of Architectural Decision Record (ADR) capturing and establish a common vocabulary.
2. Strengthen the tooling around ADRs, in support of agile practices as well as iterative and incremental software engineering processes.
3. Provide pointers to public knowledge in the context of AKM and ADRs (for instance, this website)
4. Provide a templated way to allow BCGOV Natural Resource development teams, to document critical design decisions that facilitiates and supports broader communication and collaboration on lessons learned.

NOTE: This page uses a Jeykll template. Jekyll is a static site generator. You give it text written in your favorite markup language and it uses layouts to create a static website dynamically after each git respository commit. This repo is intended as a curation as well as a template for teams to re-use.
