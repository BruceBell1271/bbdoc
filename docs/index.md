IITD Architecture Decision Record Index

## Architectural Decision Records (ADR) for Natural Resource Ministries (NRM)

An architecture decision record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. An architecture decision (AD) is a software design choice that addresses a significant requirement.

<https://bcgov.github.io/nr-arch/>

The aim of the GitHub adr organization is to:

Motivate the need for and benefits of AD capturing and establish a common vocabulary
Strengthen the tooling around ADRs, in support of agile practices as well as iterative and incremental software engineering processes
Provide pointers to public knowledge in the context of AKM and ADRs (for instance, this website)
Note: The term “architecture decision record” can be used interchangeably.
