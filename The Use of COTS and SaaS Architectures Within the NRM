## Description
For the purposes of this whitepaper, ’COTS and SaaS Architectures’ refers to solutions where
there is a proprietary code-base not under Provincial control; whether these solutions are
extensions/additions to the Sector architecture, or whether they are approved variances from it.
For example, commercial solutions, proprietary systems, free market systems, licensed services
and products.

The Investment Board (IB), formerly called the Architecture Review Board (ARB), wishes to
clarify the consideration factors that go into evaluation of opportunities to use COTS, SaaS or
similar pre-built solutions. IB has directed Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) to evaluate
any such submissions and to consider these factors in determining whether to approve detailed
evaluation of any such solution.

The IB has identified that clarity in the consideration points for these types of solutions would be
helpful for both the TAC in its reviews, but also for the target audience of submitters to the
IB/TAC: Business Portfolio Managers and Sector Architects.

In addition to providing these consideration points, sample types of questions have been
identified in order to provide some guidance to the target audience and facilitate the development
of their submission. The Enterprise Architecture (EA) Principles team has also provided some
significant contributory guidance working under the request of the TAC.
